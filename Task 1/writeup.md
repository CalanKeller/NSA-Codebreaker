This task took me around 4 to 5 minutes start to finish. 
I downloaded the task files (USCG.log and database.db), which it was clear from what to do. 
I downloaded a database exploration tool (https://sqlitebrowser.org/) and from there looked for the entries that matched the description of "geographic coordinates are within 1/100th of a degree." 
Only database entries 414 and 754 matched that description.
