# Task 1 - Find the Unknown Object - (General programming, database retrieval)
```The US Coast Guard (USCG) recorded an unregistered signal over 30 nautical miles away from the continental US (OCONUS). NSA is contacted to see if we have a record of a similar signal in our databases. The Coast guard provides a copy of the signal data. Your job is to provide the USCG any colluding records from NSA databases that could hint at the objectâ€™s location. Per instructions from the USCG, to raise the likelihood of discovering the source of the signal, they need multiple corresponding entries from the NSA database whose geographic coordinates are within 1/100th of a degree. Additionally, record timestamps should be no greater than 10 minutes apart. ```

This task took me around 4 to 5 minutes start to finish. 
I downloaded the task files (USCG.log and database.db), which it was clear from what to do. 
I downloaded a database exploration tool (https://sqlitebrowser.org/) and from there looked for the entries that matched the description of "geographic coordinates are within 1/100th of a degree." 
Only database entries 414 and 754 matched that description.
